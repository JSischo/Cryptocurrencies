# Cryptocurrencies

> The purpose of this project was to use unsupervised learning techniques to create an analysis for a ficticious group of clients who are preparing to get into the cryptocurrency market. I created a "report" that included what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for a new investment.

> The initial datafile was processed to fit the machine learning model, utilized unsupervised learning, used a clustering algorithm, and created data visualizations.

> What was accomplished during this project where the following:
> - Preprocessing of the Data for PCA
> - Reducing the Data Dimensions Using PCA
> - Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
> - Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results
